            HOLIDAY AT PALEMBANG CITY

        <p>
            At the end of third semesters ago, my family and I went to visit my grandparents who lived in Palembang. 
            We went from Jakarta on 21st August 2015 by using a plane. On our way to Palembang,  
            all I did was only listen to the music in the plane while my little brother seemed enthusiastic 
            to see the scenery from the plane. 
            After spending 4 hours in plane, we finally arrived at Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International 
            Airport (Palembang), and we continued the journey by using car. 
            And we finally arrived at my grandparentâ€™s house, yeay! 
            My grandfather and grandmother were very glad to know that we were coming. 
            They looked so surprised because we did not tell them before. 
            My grandmother served some food to us. I was very hungry after the trip. 
            After that, we had a nice conversation. We talked about Jakarta and many more. 
            The next day, my family was invited by our grandparents to come to Benteng Kuto Besak. 
            Benteng Kuto Besak is the cultural heritage located in Palembang. 
            I was so happy to be coming there. And then we were looking for a place to have a lunch. 
            And I choosed Pempek. Pempek is my favorite food. 
            It was a pleasure at that time to have a lunch with my big family in Benteng Kuto Besak. 
            In there we could enjoy our lunch and the scenery all at once. 
            After eating, we went to the Musi River. We enjoyed the atmosphere around us. 
            And we were looking for a restaurant to dinner.
            There was a pempek, tekwan, model, martabak har, nasi minyak, es kacang merah, etc. 
            I was happy. After that,we went to go home. </p>
